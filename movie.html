<h1>The Best Movies According to Andrew</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Man From Earth</h3>
<p>I love this movie because it all takes place in one cabin, meaning the focus has to be on the dialogue and the story.</p>
<h3>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</h3>
<p>Such a trip down nostalgia lane, this movie makes me feel like a kid which is why it's on my list.</p>
<h3>Chef</h3>
<p>Seeing how passionate the main character is about cooking inspires me and makes me want to do better in my own craft. </p>
