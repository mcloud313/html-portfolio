<h1>Andrew Cardin's Portfolio</h1>
<hr>
<p>My name is Andrew, I am in the middle of a career change into the
Information Technology sector. Having worked retail
for the last six years I am wanting something with more growth, and mentally stimulating
to do professionally. This webpage will serve as my online portfolio where I will show off
the technology I am learning. If you are interested in hiring
me for employment my information can be found below.</p>

<p>Also below you can find some of the current projects I am working on. These projects
may have been inspired by courses on Udemy, Coursera, or by my progression through my Bachelor's of Science
Degree in Software Engineering through Western Governor's University.</p>
